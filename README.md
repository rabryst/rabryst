### This is the part where I introduce myself

My name is **Randolph West**, and I am an actor, filmmaker, musician, author, and technologist based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

I am autistic, and unapologetically queer. My pronouns are [_they/them/theirs_](https://www.mypronouns.org/they-them).

In the mid-1980s I learned BASIC on a CreatiVision console. I upgraded to GW-BASIC, QBASIC, Turbo Pascal, Visual Basic, and finally C# (my language of choice). I know a little bit about SQL Server as well.

In January 2022 I started [working at Microsoft](https://github.com/rwestMSFT) in the SQL Docs team.
